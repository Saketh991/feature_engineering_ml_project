# Polish Bankruptcy Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains data analysis and machine learning models developed for predicting bankruptcy using the Polish companies dataset. The dataset includes over 60 financial features from various companies, aiming to predict their bankruptcy status.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to utilize advanced data visualization, clustering, and feature selection techniques to identify significant predictors of bankruptcy and build a predictive model using XGBoost. The project leverages several machine learning and data processing techniques to understand the underlying patterns and improve prediction accuracy.
